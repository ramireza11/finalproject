       <h2> This game is what I call "illusion". I want the person playing
         this "game" to get a simulation of being in a illusion </h2>
       <h3>I want them to interact with the real world and the computer world
         at the same time. </h3>
       <h4> Most of us just look at a screen 24/7 and never look around or do
         anything interactive with any game outside of our electronics. </h4>
       <h5> The creators of Pokemon Go were an inspiration towards this project
       because of how they impacted the computer world and the real world. </h5>
       <h6> I want the viewer or player to just have fun. That's all, enjoy this.</h6>
